# Check your understanding!

Serum cotinine is a continuous variable in our dataset. Let's use it to create a two-level categorical variable for nonsmoking versus smoking. Nonsmoking status can be defined as serum cotinine values less than or equal to 10 ng/mL (Pirkle et al., 1996). 
* Make a new R code chunk
* Make a new factor variable for smoking status
* The variable should have the level "smoking" for cotinine greater than 10
* The variable should have the level "nonsmoking" for cotinine less than or equal to 10
* How many observations are in the nonsmoking category? In the smoking category?

```{r}
nhanes_smk <- nhanes_dataset %>%
  mutate(smoking = case_when(LBXCOT <= 10 ~ "nonsmoking",
                              LBXCOT > 10 ~ "smoking"))
table(nhanes_smk$smoking)
```
